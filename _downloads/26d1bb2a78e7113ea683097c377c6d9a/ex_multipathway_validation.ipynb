        "# Validating multi-pathway models based on the data\n\nHow to determine whether the dipolar signal model defined with the\nset of specified dipolar pathways pathways is a proper descriptor of\nthe experimental data. \n\nThis example shows how to use goodness-of-fit criteria to determine \nwhether enough dipolar pathways have been accounted for in the model.  \n\nA model that accurately describes the data must result in a residual vector\nthat is normally distributed, has zero mean, and has no significant \nautocorrelations. In this example, we will look at an experimental 4-pulse DEER\ndataset acquired on a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and use the built-in \ngoodness-of-fit tools to quantitatively validate whether the dataste is well described by a \ndipolar model with a single, two or three dipolar pathways.\n"
