## About

DeerLab is a comprehensive free scientific software package for Python focused on modelling, penalized least-squares regression, and uncertainty quantification. 
It provides highly specialized on the analysis of dipolar EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy data. Dipolar EPR spectroscopy techniques include DEER (double electron-electron resonance), RIDME (relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement), and others. 

The documentation can be found [here](https://jeschkelab.github.io/DeerLab/index.html).

The early versions of DeerLab (up to version 0.9.2) are written in MATLAB. The old MATLAB codebase is archived and can be found [here](https://github.com/JeschkeLab/DeerLab-Matlab).

## Requirements

DeerLab is available for Windows, Mac and Linux systems and requires **Python 3.6**, **3.7**, **3.8**, **3.9**, or  **3.10**.

All additional dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed during the setup.
 
## Setup

A pre-built distribution can be installed from the PyPI repository using `pip`.

From a terminal (preferably with admin privileges) use the following command to install from PyPI:

    python -m pip install deerlab

More details on the installation and updating of DeerLab can be found [here](https://jeschkelab.github.io/DeerLab/installation.html).
