Validating multi-pathway models based on the data
-------------------------------------------------------------------

How to determine whether the dipolar signal model defined with the
set of specified dipolar pathways pathways is a proper descriptor of
the experimental data. 

This example shows how to use goodness-of-fit criteria to determine 
whether enough dipolar pathways have been accounted for in the model.  

A model that accurately describes the data must result in a residual vector
that is normally distributed, has zero mean, and has no significant 
autocorrelations. In this example, we will look at an experimental 4-pulse DEER
dataset acquired on a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and use the built-in 
goodness-of-fit tools to quantitatively validate whether the dataste is well described by a 
dipolar model with a single, two or three dipolar pathways.

# The first model is clearly underparametrized as it results in 
# non-normal residuals and strong correlations. This is supported by the large chi-squared value.
# Adding the second pathway seems to improve the description of the data, 
# as the residuals are now better distributed. However, there appears to be some autocorrelations 
# left and the chi-squared value still presents too large values. 
# Adding the third pathway results in the best description of the data, 
# with normally distributed residuals and no significant autocorrelations.
