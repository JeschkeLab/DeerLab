"""
Basic fitting of a 4-pulse DEER signal, with 2+1 contribution
====================================================================

This example shows how to fit a 4-pulse DEER signal with a non-parametric
distribution, including the "2+1" pathway contribution.

# Now, if we take the "2+1" contribution into account, the 4pDEER model
# contains 3 additional parameters compared to a simplified 4pDEER model (due
# to the additional dipolar pathway present in the signal). However, the
# refocusing time of the second dipolar pathway is very easy to constrain
# and strongly helps stabilizing the fit. 
# 
# This pathway can even estimated visually from the signal or estimated from the 
# pulse sequence timings. Thus, we can strongly constraint this parameters while leaving the
# pathway amplitudes pretty much unconstrained.
