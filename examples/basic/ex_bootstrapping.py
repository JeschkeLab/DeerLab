# Unless specified otherwise, the function ``fitmodel`` will return asymptotic confidence intervals based on the covariance matrix 
# of the objective function used to fit the data. These are quick to calculate and therefore very comfortable for quick estimates of
# the uncertainty during routine analysis or testing. 
#
# However, for publication-level analysis, these confidence intervals might be inaccurate. It is strongly recommended to employ bootstrapped 
# confidence intervals to get accurate estimates of the uncertainty. 
# Conviniently, ``fitmodel`` integrates bootstrapping to make it accessible by only adjusting the option ``'uq'`` to ``'bootstrap'``. 
# The option also allows to specify the number of samples to analyze to estimate the uncertainty. The larger this number, the more accurate 
# the confidence intervals but the longer the analysis will be. The standard for publication is typically 1000 samples. 
#
# If the option ``'verbose'`` is enabled, a progress bar will be shown indicating the remaining time for the bootstrapping to finish.
#
# In this example, for the sake of time, we will just use 50 bootstrap samples.

r = np.linspace(2,5,200)
BootSamples = 50 # For publication-grade analysis, the standard is 1000
