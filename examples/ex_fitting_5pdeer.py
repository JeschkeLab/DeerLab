Fitting a 5-pulse DEER signal with a parameter-free distribution
==================================================================

This example shows how to fit a 5-pulse DEER signal with a non-parametric
distribution, a background, and all pathways parameters.

# Now, 5pDEER data contain 3 additional parameters compared to 4pDEER (due
# to the additional dipolar pathway present in the signal). However, the
# refocusing time of the second dipolar pathway is very easy to constrain
# and strongly helps stabilizing the fit. 
# 
# This pathway ususally refocuses at around ``t = max(t)/2``, and usually can
# be even estimated from simple visual inspection of the signal. 
# Thus, we can strongly constraint this parameters while leaving the
# pathway amplitudes pretty much unconstrained.
