  summary: 'Comprehensive package for data analysis of dipolar EPR spectroscopy'
  description: |
    DeerLab is a Python package for the analysis of dipolar EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance)
    spectroscopy data. Dipolar EPR spectroscopy techniques include DEER (double electron-electron resonance),
    RIDME (relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement), and others.
    DeerLab consists of a collection of functions for modelling, data processing, and least-squares fitting.
    They can be combined in scripts to build custom data analysis workflows. DeerLab supports both classes of 
    distance distribution models: non-parametric (Tikhonov regularization and related) and parametric 
    (multi-Gaussians etc). It also provides a selection of background and experiment models.
