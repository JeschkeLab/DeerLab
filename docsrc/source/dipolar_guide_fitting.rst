Fitting
============


Fitting the model
*****************

The model ``Vmodel`` can be fitted to the experimental data ``V`` by calling the ``fit`` function: ::

    result = dl.fit(Vmodel,Vexp)  # Fit the model to the experimental data


After ``fit`` has found a solution, it returns an object that we assigned to ``result``. This object contains fields with all quantities of interest with the fit results, such as the fitted model and parameters, goodness-of-fit statistics, and uncertainty information. Check out the :ref:`fitting guide <fitting_fitresult>` for more details on the quantities provided in ``result``.


Adding penalties
*****************

Penalty terms can be added to the objective function to impose certain properties upon the solution. While DeerLab can take any kind of penalty function (see the :ref:`fitting guide <fitting_guide>` for details), for dipolar models it provides a specialized function ``dipolarpenalty`` which easily generates penalties based on the distance distribution. 

To generate such a penalty, you must provide the model ``Pmodel`` for the distance distribution (as provided in ``dipolarmodel``), as well as the distance axis vector ``r``. Next, the type of penalty must be specified: 

- ``'compactness'``: Imposes compactness of the distance distribution. A compact distribution avoid having distribution mass spread towards the edges of the distance axis vector. 
- ``'smoothness'``: Imposes smoothness of the distance distribution. This is particularly useful for imposing smoothness of parametric models of the distance distribution. For non-parametric distributions, smoothness is already imposed by the regularization criterion, making this penalty unnecessary. 

All penalties are weighted by a weighting parameter, which is optimized according to a selection criterion which must be specified to the ``dipolarpenalty method``. For the ``smoothness`` penalty, the ``'aic'`` criterion is recommended, while for the ``smoothness`` criterion, the ``'icc'`` criterion is recommended.

The ``dipolarpenalty`` function will return a ``Penalty`` object which can be passed to the fit function through the ``penalties`` keyword argument. 


Example: Fitting a non-parametric distribution with a compactness criterion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, to introduce compactness in the fit of a dipolar model with a non-parametric distance distribution we must set the distribution model to ``None`` to indicate a non-parametric distribution ::

    compactness_penalty = dl.dipolarpenalty(None, r, 'compactness', 'icc')
    results = dl.fit(Vmodel,Vexp, penalties=compactness_penalty)

Example: Fitting a Gaussian distribution with a compactness criterion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, to introduce compactness in the fit of a dipolar model with a Gaussian distance distribution we must set the distribution model to ``dd_gauss`` to indicate the parametric distribution ::

    compactness_penalty = dl.dipolarpenalty(dl.dd_gauss, r, 'compactness', 'icc')
    results = dl.fit(Vmodel,Vexp, penalties=compactness_penalty)

Displaying the results
**********************

For just a quick display of the results, you can use the ``plot()`` method of the ``fit`` object that will display a figure with you experimental data, the corresponding fit including confidence bands. :: 

    results.plot(axis=t,xlabel='Time (Œºs)') # display results

For a quick summary of the fit results, including goodness-of-fit statistics, used model hyperparameters, and the fitted model parameter values (including 95% confidence intervals), can be accessed by just printing the ``results`` object: ::

The first table contains all the goodness-of-fit statistics (see below). The second table summarizes all the hyperparameters used 
in the final evaluation of the model. If regularization is enabled (as is the case when using non-parametric distance distributions)
its final value will be shown. If additional penalties have been added to the fit, their regularization parameters (i.e. penalty weights) will be shown as well.  

The third table summarizes all the model parameter estimates along with their uncertainties and model descriptions. 
The values of vectorized parameters such as ``P`` are not shown in this summary and shown instead as ``...``. The additional value ``P_scale`` corresponds to the overall scaling factor of the distance distribution (and hence of the dipolar signal) since the fitted distance distribution is normalized such that ``trapz(P,r)==1``.    

Any specific quantities can be extracted from the ``results`` object. For each parameter in the model, the ``results`` output contains an attribute ``results.<parameter>`` named after the parameter containing the fitted value of that parameter, as well as another attribute ``results.<parameter>Uncert`` containing the uncertainty estimates of that parameter, from which confidence intervals can be constructed (the :ref:`uncertainty guide <uncertainty>` for details). For example: :: 

    # Distance distribution 
    results.P # Fitted distance distribution 
    results.PUncert.ci(95) # Distance distribution 95% confidence intervals

    # Modulation depth 
    results.mod # Fitted modulation depth 
    results.modUncert.ci(95) # Modulation depth 95% confidence intervals

Assessing the goodness-of-fit
****************************** 

The results summary shown above contains several key quantities to quickly assess whether the model estimate obtained by the ``fit`` 
function is a proper descriptor of the data. For each dataset analyzed, several quantities are returned. The ``Noise level`` value shows 
either the estimated noise level of that dataset or the one specified by the user. The ``Reduced ùõò2`` value indicates how good the model fit describes the data. Values close to 1 indicate a good fit of the data. The ``Residual autocorr.`` value (computed as `\vert 2 - d_\mathrm{DW} \vert`, where `d_\mathrm{DW}` is the Durbin‚ÄìWatson statistic) indicates the degree of (first-order) autocorrelation in the fit residual. Values larger than 0.5 indicate a significant amount of autocorrelation, meaning that either the noise if not independent or that the model might not have fully captured all features in the data. Such autocorrelation con commonly originate from a simplified distance distribution model failing to capture all dipolar modulations or a insufficient set of dipolar pathways that fail to capture all contributions to the data. The ``RMSD`` value does not provide any insight by itself, however, it can be used to compare the goodness-of-fit between different models.

To facilitate the inspection of the goodness-of-fit, DeerLab will highlight those values that indicate a potential failure of the analysis. If either or both the ``Reduced ùõò2`` or ``Residual autocorr.`` values are highlighted in yellow, it will indicate that there is a significant possibility that the model does not properly describe the data. In such cases, one must inspect, e.g. visually using ``results.plot(gof=True)`` (see :ref:`here <fitting_goodnessoffit>` for details), whether the model estimate actually is a good descriptor of the data. If the values are shown in red, it will indicate that the model does certainly not properly describe the data. 

If yellow or red goodness-of-fit quantities are obtained after an analysis, the following steps can be taken to amend that: 

- Check for outliers or features in the data not accounted for by the model. 
- Expand the model to account for them or approximate their presence. 
- If the model cannot be expanded to account for them, make use of the ``fit`` function's ``masks`` optional argument to specify data masks so that those features are not accounted for during the analysis. 


Exporting the figure and the data
*********************************

After completing the fit, you might want to export the figure with the fit. Here is one way to do it: ::

    figure = fit.plot()                       # get figure object
    figure.savefig('DEERFig.png', dpi=600)    # save figure as png file
    figure.savefig('DEERFig.pdf')             # save figure as pdf file

To export the fitted distance distribution for plotting with another software, save it in a simple text file ::

    np.savetxt('distancedistribution.txt', np.asarray((r, fit.P, *fit.Puncert.ci(95).T)).T)

The generated file contain four columns: the distance axis, the distance distributions, and the upper and lower confidence bounds. The ``.T`` indicate array transposes, which are used to get the confidence bands into the column format for saving.

To export the fitted time-domain trace, use similarly ::

    np.savetxt('timetrace.txt', np.asarray((t, V, fit.V, *fit.Vuncert.ci(95).T)).T)
