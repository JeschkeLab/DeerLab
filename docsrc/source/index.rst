DeerLab is a comprehensive free scientific software package for Python focused on modeling, penalized least-squares regression, and uncertainty quantification. It also provides specialized models and tools for the analysis of dipolar EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy techniques such as DEER (double electron-electron resonance), and others. 

DeerLab's Key Applications
-----------------------------------------

- **Modeling** of dipolar EPR signals
- **Uncertainty quantification** of dipolar EPR signals
- **Multi-pathway** modeling support
- **Comapactness criterion** to improve background selection 
- **Global fitting** of multiple datasets simultaneously 
- ... and much more!

Getting Started with DeerLab
-----------------------------------------

We have a User Guide that explains how to install and use DeerLab. In addition, we have a set of examples that demonstrate how to use DeerLab for various applications, from basic to advanced.

In addition, there is both a cheatsheet that can be downloaded and printed for quick reference, and a online workshop that covers the basics of DeerLab.
